To calculate the total number of weights in the convolutional neural network described, we need to consider each layer separately:

Layer 1: Convolutional Layer

*Input Size: 100x100 (grayscale, so 1 channel)
*Filter Size: 5x5
*Number of Filters: 100
*Weights: Each filter has 5x5 weights and there's 1 bias per filter.
    Weights per filter = 5 x 5 =25
    Total weights = 25 × 100=2500
    Total biases = 100 (1 per filter)
    
    Total for Layer 1: 2500+100=2600


Layer 2: Convolutional Layer

*Input Channels: 100 (from Layer 1)
*Filter Size: 5x5
*Number of Filters: 100
*Weights: Each filter has 5x5 weights for each input channel.
    Weights per filter = 5×5×100=2500
    Total weights = 2500×100=250,000
    Total biases = 100 (1 per filter)
    
    Total for Layer 2: 250,000+100=250,100


Layer 3: Max Pooling Layer

No weights or biases as this is a pooling layer.


Layer 4: Dense Layer

*Input Units: After max pooling, the size is reduced to 50x50, and there are 100 channels.
*Output Units: 100
*Weights: Each output unit is connected to each input unit.
    Input size = 50×50×100=250,000
    Weights = 250,000×100=25,000,000
    Total biases = 100 (1 per output unit)

    Total for Layer 4: 25,000,000+100=25,000,100


Layer 5: Dense Layer

*Input Units: 100 (from Layer 4)
*Output Units: 100
*Weights: Each output unit is connected to each input unit.
    Weights = 100×100=10,000
    Total biases = 100 (1 per output unit)
    
    Total for Layer 5: 10,000+100=10,100


Layer 6: Output Layer

*Input Units: 100 (from Layer 5)
*Output Units: 1
*Weights: Each output unit is connected to each input unit.
    Weights = 100×1=100
    Total biases = 1 (1 for the output unit)
    
    Total for Layer 6: 100+1=101



Total Weights = Layer 1 + Layer 2 + Layer 4 + Layer 5 + Layer 6
Total Weights = 2600 + 250,100 + 25,000,100 + 10,100 + 101 = 25,262,001

Therefore, the total number of weights in this network is 25,262,001.
