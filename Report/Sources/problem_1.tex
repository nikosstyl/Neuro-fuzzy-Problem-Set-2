\section{Problem 1}
In this exercise we need to find the minimum of the given 2-dimensional function:\\
\begin{equation}	
		F(\mathbf{w})=w_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}+(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{2}+(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{4}	
\end{equation}
with the Conjugate Gradient (Fletcher-Reeves) method.\\

Initially, we can conclude that the function $F(w)$ is not in quadratic form because of the term $(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{4}$.
A function is said to be in quadratic form if it can be expressed as a second-degree polynomial where all the terms are either squared terms or cross-products of the variables. The presence of the fourth-degree term $(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{4}$.
makes this function a higher-degree polynomial, specifically a quartic function with respect to $(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})$, which means it cannot be classified as quadratic.\\
Also, the independent values in this function are $w_{1},w_{2}$, because only with them we can manipulate the $F(w)$.\\ B

As an initial guess we have $w\left(0\right) = \left[3, 3\right]^T$.\\
Î¤he steps we have to use are specific for each iteration

\begin{center}
	\underline{\textit{FIRST ITERATION k = 0}}
\end{center}

\underline{Step1: Calculate the Gradient at  $w\left(k\right)$ }\\
\(\nabla f(w_1,w_2) = \left(\begin{array}{c}
	\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial w_1} \\[4mm]
	\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial w_2}
\end{array}\right)\) = $\left(\begin{array}{c}
	2w_1 + (0.5w_1+w_2) + 2(0.5w_1+w_2)^3\\[1mm]
	2w_2 + 2(0.5w_1+w_2) + 4(0.5w_1+w_2)^3
\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}
	2.5w_1 + w_2 + 2(0.5w_1+w_2)^3\\[1mm]
	w_1 + 4w_2 + 4(0.5w_1+w_2)^3
\end{array}\right)$ \\[3mm]

where at the point $w\left(0\right) = \left[3, 3\right]^T$ we have $\nabla f(x) = \left(\begin{array}{c}
	-53 \\
	-19
\end{array}\right)$
