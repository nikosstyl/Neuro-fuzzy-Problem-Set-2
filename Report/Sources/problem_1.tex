\section{Problem 1}
In this exercise we need to find the minimum of the given 2-dimensional function:\\
\begin{equation}	
		F(\mathbf{w})=w_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}+(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{2}+(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{4}	
\end{equation}
with the Conjugate Gradient (Fletcher-Reeves) method.\\

Initially, we can conclude that the function $F(w)$ is not in quadratic form because of the term $(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{4}$.
A function is said to be in quadratic form if it can be expressed as a second-degree polynomial where all the terms are either squared terms or cross-products of the variables. The presence of the fourth-degree term $(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})^{4}$.
makes this function a higher-degree polynomial, specifically a quartic function with respect to $(0.5w_{1}+w_{2})$, which means it cannot be classified as quadratic.\\
Also, the independent values in this function are $w_{1},w_{2}$, because only with them we can manipulate the $F(w)$.
