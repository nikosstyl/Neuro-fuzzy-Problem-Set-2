\section{Problem 13}
Max-pooling is a process used for downsapling the input or reducing its dimensionality. It works by sliding a window across the input and taking the maximum value within that window as an output.

\subsection{Question A}
Max pooling can be accomplished using ReLU operations and in this Question we will show it and we will express $\max(a,b)$ by using them.\\

To begin with, ReLU, as we have mentioned before, is an activation function that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For inputs $x$ where $x > 0$, the output is $x$.
	\item For inputs $x$ where $x \leq 0$, the output is $0$
\end{itemize}

Mathematically it is defined as: $\operatorname{ReLU}(x)=\operatorname*{max}(x,0)$\\

Taking this into account, to express the $\max(a,b)$ by using only ReLU operations, we can consider the following expression:\\
\begin{equation}
	max(a,b) = a \cdot ReLU(a-b) + b \cdot ReLU(b-a).
	\label{eq:problem13}
\end{equation}


Therefore, now we need to prove it: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bm{For\ \ a > b:}$\\
	$a - b > 0 $ and $b - a < 0$.\\
	$\operatorname{ReLU}(a - b) = a - b$ and  $\operatorname{ReLU}(b - a) = 0$
	\vspace{1mm}
	
	By replacing these values into Equation~\ref{eq:problem13} we will have:
	
	$max(a,b) = a\cdot(a-b) + b\cdot0 = a\cdot(a-b).$
	\vspace{1mm}
	
	In this result, $a > b$, so it is the maximum value between these two and $(a - b) > 0$. Thus, the product is positive and the possible maximum.
	\vspace{1mm}
	
	Hence, the expression max(a,b) evaluates to the maximum of $a,b$.
	
	\item $\bm{For\ \ a < b:}$\\
	$a - b < 0 $ and $b - a > 0$.\\
	$\operatorname{ReLU}(a - b) = 0$ and  $\operatorname{ReLU}(b - a) = b - a$
	\vspace{1mm}
	
	By replacing these values into Equation~\ref{eq:problem13} we will have:
	
	$max(a,b) = a\cdot0 + b\cdot(b-a) = b\cdot(b-a).$
	\vspace{1mm}
	
	Similarly, $b > a$, so it is the maximum value between these two and $(b - a) > 0$. Thus, the product is positive and the possible maximum.
	\vspace{1mm}
	
	Additionally, the expression max(a,b) evaluates to the maximum of $a,b$ too.
\end{itemize}
Everything considered, we can express $\max(a,b)$ as $max(a,b) = a\cdot(a-b) + b\cdot0 = a\cdot(a-b).$
